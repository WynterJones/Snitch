ü§ñ **AI-Powered Request Analysis**

The magic happens with our OpenAI integration. Add your API key in settings, then click "Analyze with AI" on any captured request for instant plain-English explanations:
‚Ä¢ What the request does and why it was made
‚Ä¢ What the response data means
‚Ä¢ Potential security or privacy implications  
‚Ä¢ Technical insights made simple

No coding knowledge required - just intelligent insights that make web traffic understandable.
